# Player vs Computer Rock Paper Scissors

This is my first rock paper scissors python script the utilises player input and the random selection module for the opponent.
This game utilises a 'While' loop with an accumulating scoring system which can be ended after any round.



UPDATES TO COME: 
1: PyGame for this script to provide graphical gameplay.
2: NEW game with upgraded rules. Python script + PyGame Interaction version.
